## Hello World!
I'm Yu Yang, a year 1 IT student at Ngee Ann. I have interests in AI, malware development and software engineering. I'll be playing CDDC!

## Skills
Some languages I can use are **Python, C#, JavaScript, C++, x86 Assembly, Java, Lua and PHP**. I've tried **Go** for a short while too!

Within Python, I have some experience with libraries, mainly **Keras and Tensorflow**.

My favourite learning resources include **LeetCode** and **Codewars** for practice, and **Stack Overflow** for seeking answers to questions.

## Tools
My favourite general-purpose IDE is **VS Code**. However, depending on the task, I usually opt for various JetBrains IDEs (i.e Rider, CLion etc). On my **Arch Linux** desktop (i use arch btw), I use **Neovim**.
Beyond IDEs, I've also used some tools from Adobe Creative Cloud. Some other tools I have experience with are **Git, Github, Heroku, Power BI and Figma**.
